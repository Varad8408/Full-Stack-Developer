            <h2>Prehistory</h2>
            <p>In 1993, remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the south foreshore upstream from Vauxhall
                Bridge.[39] Two of the timbers were radiocarbon dated to 1750–1285 BC.[39] In 2010, foundations of a
                large timber structure, dated to 4800–4500 BC,[40] were found on the Thames's south foreshore
                downstream
                from Vauxhall Bridge.[41] Both structures are on the south bank of the Thames, where the
                now-underground
                River Effra flows into the Thames.[41]</p>

            <h2>Roman London</h2>

                    Despite the evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement
                    was
                    founded by the Romans around 47 AD,[2] about four years after their invasion of 43 AD.[42] This
                    only
                    lasted until about 61 AD, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it and burnt it to
                    the
                    ground.[43]</p>

            <p>The next planned incarnation of Londinium prospered, superseding Colchester as the principal city of
                the
                Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a population
                of
                about 60,000.[44]</p>

            <h2>Anglo-Saxon and Viking-period London</h2>
            <div class="para para2">
                <p>The Lancastrian siege of London in 1471 is attacked by a Yorkist sally.
                    With the early 5th-century collapse of Roman rule, the walled city of Londinium was effectively
                    abandoned, although Roman civilisation continued around St Martin-in-the-Fields until about
                    450.[45]
                    From about 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed slightly west of the old
                    Roman
                    city.[46] By about 680 the city had become a major port again, but there is little evidence of
                    large-scale production. From the 820s repeated Viking assaults brought decline. Three are
                    recorded;
                    those in 851 and 886 succeeded, while the last, in 994, was rebuffed.[47]</p>

            <p>The Vikings applied Danelaw over much of eastern and northern England, its boundary running roughly
                from
                London to Chester as an area of political and geographical control imposed by the Viking incursions
                formally agreed by the Danish warlord, Guthrum and the West Saxon king Alfred the Great in 886. The
                Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that Alfred "refounded" London in 886. Archaeological research shows
                this
                involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls. London
                then grew slowly until a dramatic increase in about 950.[48]</p>

            <div class=" para para1">
                <p>By the 11th century, London was clearly the largest town in England. Westminster Abbey, rebuilt
                    in
                    Romanesque style by King Edward the Confessor, was one of the grandest churches in Europe.
                    Winchester
                    had been the capital of Anglo-Saxon England, but from this time London became the main forum for
                    foreign
                    traders and the base for defence in time of war. In the view of Frank Stenton: "It had the
                    resources,
                    and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a
                    national
                    capital."[49]</p>
